This component keeps track of a list of pioneers in the field of programming on the one hand,
and the id of the currently featured programmer on the other. That's two slices of state!
We can only feature one awesome programmer at a time.

Find comments below to help you along.

//Importing react (statehook)from react
//Import React from library react, extends jsx code functionality to the project
import React, { useState } from "react";

// Use this variable ONLY to initialize a slice of state!
// There is something in the JSX right now breaking this rule...
export const listOfAwesome = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Ada Lovelace' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Grace Hopper' },
  { id: '3', name: 'Evelyn Boyd Granville' },

  { id: '6', name: 'Carol Shaw' },

/*We'll have to use the state hook twice, as we need two slices of state.
The programmers list on the one hand, and the id of the featured programmer on the other.*/

//Programmers() definition, no parameters
export default function Programmers() 
{
  //Declare state variable, init with array of square IDs
  const [programmersArray] = useState(listOfAwesome);
  
  //Declare state variable, set function.init to null 
  const [programmersId, setProgrammersId] = useState(null);

  /*Leave this for last!
  This is NOT an event handler but a helper function. See its usage inside the JSX.
  It's going to utilize both slices of state to return the _name_ of the featured dev.
  The beauty of closures is that we can "see" both slices of state from this region
  of the program, without needing to inject the information through arguments.
